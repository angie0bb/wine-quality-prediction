# Predicting Wine Quality & Wine Recommendation System
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PYTHON-3776AB?style=flat&logo=Python&logoColor=white"/> 
Data Science project on predicting wine quality and building a recommender system using two datasets - Wine Quality dataset and Wine Reviews dataset.  

  
**Research Questions**  
- What is the relationship between various factors, such as chemical properties, origin, and price, and wine quality/rating  
- What are the most critical factors that contribute to wine quality/rating  
- How reliable is the predictive model and what are its potential limitations  
- How can a recommendation system be developed for wine selection based on individual preferences and wine characteristics?  
- Can natural language processing (NLP) techniques be used to analyze wine reviews and understand consumer preferences and opinions   

## Data Source
1. Wine Quality  
   Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality Citation: P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis. Modelling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553, 2009.
2. Wine Reviews  
   Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews The data was scraped from http://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine during 2017.

## Approach
The project will utilize a combination of more “traditional” statistical approaches and machine learning techniques to explore and understand the relationships between various factors and wine quality/rating. Evaluating model performances using both statistical and machine learning approaches will allow us to choose the more appropriate model.   

## Workflow  
1)	Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis (Python & Tableau)      
2)	Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning Models   
3)	Interpretation and Evaluation of Results  
4)	Recommender System for Wine  
5)	Visualizations with Flask
