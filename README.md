# Predicting Wine Quality & Wine Recommendation System
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PYTHON-3776AB?style=flat&logo=Python&logoColor=white"/> 
Data Science project on predicting wine quality and building a recommender system using two datasets - Wine Quality dataset and Wine Reviews dataset.  

  
**Research Questions**  
- What is the relationship between various factors, such as chemical properties, origin, and price, and wine quality/rating  
- What are the most critical factors that contribute to wine quality/rating  
- How reliable is the predictive model and what are its potential limitations  
- How can a recommendation system be developed for wine selection based on individual preferences and wine characteristics?  
- Can natural language processing (NLP) techniques be used to analyze wine reviews and understand consumer preferences and opinions
